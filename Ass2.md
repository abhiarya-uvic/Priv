## 1. Purpose of the review

This document provides a comprehensive assessment of architectural documentation of Swagger UI system by answering a specific set of questions. The purpose of this review is to convey worthiness of the documentation to the senior project developers/lead of the system. This will critique the good and bad artifacts of the AD with respect to answering the key quality attribute questions of the system and will suggest potential future roadmap.

## 2. Subject of the review

The subject of this review is the architecture documentation created by team for Swagger UI system. The architecture document must provide sufficient details to convey various aspects of the system and key quality attributes for review.

  1. Are the business goals of system clearly articulated and prioritized?</br></br>
  2. Is the context of the system (or subsystem) clearly defined? </br></br>
  3. Have the stakeholders and their concerns been clearly defined? </br></br>
  4. Is there a clear understanding of the quality attributes that the architecture must satisfy? </br></br>
  5. Are the quality attributes measurable? </br></br>
  6. Are the quality attributes achievable? </br></br>
  7. Are any of the quality attributes urealistic? </br></br>
  8. Are the ASRs that the system must satisfy clearly articulated and prioritized according to their impact on the architecture? </br></br>
  9. Can you determine the views necessary to analyze key quality attributes? Does the AD provide the views necessary to cover each QAS? </br></br>
  10. Are you able to identify key behavioral properties of the system? </br></br>
  11. Are any points of variation to the system captured in the AD? </br></br>
  12. Are the relationships between system and external components explicitly documented? </br></br>
  13. Does the AD contain the rationale for its architectural design decisions? </br></br>
  14. Can the AD support analysis of interfaces of other systems and their architectures? Does it define the relationship with other dependent architectures? </br></br>
  15. Are there any known inconsistencies to the system documented in AD? </br>
