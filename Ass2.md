## 1. Purpose of the review

This document provides a comprehensive assessment of architectural documentation of Swagger UI system by answering a specific set of questions. The purpose of this review is to convey worthiness of the documentation to the senior project developers/lead of the system. This will critique the good and bad artifacts of the AD with respect to answering the key quality attribute questions of the system and will suggest potential future roadmap.

## 2. Subject of the review

The subject of this review is the architecture documentation created by team for Swagger UI system. The architecture document must provide sufficient details to convey various aspects of the system and key quality attributes for review.

## 3. Question set for the review

<table align="left">

  <tr><td colspan=4><b>1. Question set name:</b> Evaluating system AD in regards to key quality attributes.</td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan=4><b>2. Purpose:</b> This question set could be utilized to check whether the architecture document is ready to be evaluated to answer key quality attribute questions. The questions helps to assess if the document contains sufficient information defining its quality and completeness and its suitability to be presented at an architecture review board.</td></tr>
  <tr><td colspan=4><b>3. Stakeholders and concerns:</b> The lead of the project is concerned with whether the document provides sufficient information for evaluation and usability of the AD. The project lead would like to utilize the AD to take design decision in terms if the system satisfies key quality attributes. 
An architecture evaluation is concerned with answering what, why and how to evaluate, and whether the AD supplies sufficient information for analysis.</td></tr>

  <tr>
  <td>
  1. Are the business goals of system clearly articulated and prioritized?</br></br>
  2. Have the stakeholders and their concerns been clearly defined? </br></br>
  3. Is there a clear understanding of the quality attributes that the architecture must satisfy? </br></br>
  4. Are the quality attributes measurable? </br></br>
  5. Are the quality attributes achievable? </br></br>
  6. Are any of the quality attributes unrealistic? </br></br>
  7. Are the ASRs that the system must satisfy clearly articulated and prioritized according to their impact on the architecture? </br></br>
  8. Can you determine the views necessary to analyze key quality attributes? Does the AD provide the views necessary to cover each QAS? </br></br>
  9. Is the context of the system clearly defined? </br></br>
  10. Are you able to identify key behavioral properties of the system? </br></br>
  11. Are any points of variation to the system captured in the AD? </br></br>
  12. Are the relationships between system and external components explicitly documented? </br></br>
  13. Does the AD contain the rationale for its architectural design decisions? </br></br>
  14. Can the AD support analysis of interfaces of other systems and their architectures? Does it define the relationship with other dependent architectures? </br></br>
  15. Are there any known inconsistencies to the system documented in AD? </br>

  <tr><td colspan=4><b>Advice:</b> The same set of questions could be shared with new comer to the project to have better understanding in evaluating system architecture in regards to key quality attributes and also concerns such as does this AD meet all of the conformance points? Can this conformance be verified?</td></tr>

## 4. Plan for the review


## 5. Analysis and summary of review

### 5.1 Analysis of the result

**Q1. Are the business goals of system clearly articulated and prioritized?** </br>
Business goals of the system are very well categorized into three sections: Goal-object, Goal and Remarks/references. The goal-object puts the business goal into its most condensed category which makes the evaluation of business goals effective. 
Remarks/references section provide link to an artifact of system(such as Swagger UI's home page, Blog page, etc.) for each of the business goal which tries to provide evidence for each of the goal. However, it fails to deliver clear understanding on why the specific reference is related to the corresponding business goal.</br>

Total 11 business goals are articulated in the AD which depicts quite important business goal aspects of the system and so is very well prioritized among other secondary goals.
