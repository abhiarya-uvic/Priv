### 1. Introduction<a name="introduction"></a>
<BR><BR>
The effectiveness and completeness of an architecture documentation (AD) are decided after it passes the review process. The review process is done in accordance with the SEI's review instruction document where each review is divided to purpose, subject, question, plan, perform and summary.
In this document we will be performing the review process on documentation generated by a group of students who wrote it as a part of their class project. They selected Toyplot as an open source project under their investigation. The documentation is divided into four artifacts so we will use 4 set of questions to review to complete set of artifacts.
*Toyplot*, which is a *Python* based plotting toolkit. It has a user-friendly, minimalist interface for developing beautiful, interactive and animated plots. It ensures that various visualizations like graph visualizations, scatter plots, tabular plots, matrix plots and line plots are supported. Added functionality for easy data import and export in various formats like CSV.

### 2. Purpose of the Review <a name="purpose"></a>
<BR><BR>
Every architecture documentation review is conducted keeping a specific purpose in mind. Because of the nature of architecture documentation(AD) review, its hard to say weather its correct or incorrect but we can surely test if it can server the intended purpose. In this section we will try to identify the main purpose behind this AD review process.
As per the SEI documentation, we have categorized the purpose of our AD review in the following two categories:-
1.AD suitability to support its intended purpose.
The Purpose of this review process will be the extract answers from AD to all the question that different stakeholders of the architecture may have. In other words, we will review AD against the stakeholder requirements to use, modify, infer and extend the system. Some examples of stakeholder questions:-
* Project Manager - Will AD help us in project planning and scheduling ?
* Team Lead - Will AD help us to structure team and divide work ?
 <BR>
2.AD suitability to support architecture evaluation/analysis.
We will carry our the AD review process to see if the documentation can give us essential information to answer question related to system qualities and specifications when looking at the architecture.
AD review will test the documentation against questions related to key design decisions. We will expect the rational to provide us thorough qualitative information about the potential to take the system to expected success map. This way we can implement similar architecture to other software models sharing common goals.
All these purposes will be handled individually by different set of documents available for review.
<BR><BR>
### 3. Establishing the Subject<a name="subject"></a>
<BR><BR>
In order to conduct a meaningful AD review, we need to select the subject. We have selected documents/artifacts form team 5 (Toyplot) to review. In our case, the architecture is nor presented as a single document but in a series of the decision and design artifacts.
The list of artifacts is as follows:-
* Business Goals and Stakeholders
* QAS and Utility tree
* Module View
* Component Connector View
Additional Component requirement
* Toyplot Github repository Access
* Toyplot documentation
<BR><BR>
### 4. Building the Question Set <a name="q"></a>
<BR><BR>
Since we have four different aspects/artifacts of the system architecture - business goals/stakeholders, quality attribute scenarios/ utility tree, module view, and component connector view. Each of these has a different set of questions to be answered in the review process. Question set and their answers from the heart of the entire review process.
<BR><BR>
#### 4.1 Question Set 1 <a name="q1"></a>
<BR><BR>
1. **Question set name:** Capturing the correct business goals and stakeholders.
2. **Purpose:** Use this question set to verify if all the listed business goals are complete and have references were possible. Stakeholders are documented using the stakeholder profile table.
3. **Stakeholders and concerns:** Everyone who is involved in the project or had to use AD in some way or the other.
| Questions | Respondents | Expected answers | Criticality |
|-------------|-------------|-----|------|
| Q1 - As per the project documentation, github, and other resources: is the stakeholder table complete?<BR><BR> Q2 - Find if the stakeholder table list all the important concerns these stakeholders have.<BR><BR> Q3 -  Find out if the listed business goals are complete and in accordance with the project idea or vision.<BR><BR> Q4 - IS each goal having a broader object that it relates to.<BR><BR> Q5 - Find out if the business goals have an empirical base and listed with its source for quick reference.     | Self(Stakeholders) | All the interacting stakeholders should be covered and documented using the stakeholder profile table. The stakeholders should make relevance to the system that is designed. The concerns related to these stakeholders should be documented with each concern having at-least a stakeholder. The business goals should be based on empirical data taken from the trusted sources.  | Questions that confirm completeness of stakeholders and business goals are most critical.       |
5. **Advice:** This question set can be used once you have the documentation already available and stakeholder identification is complete.
<BR><BR>
#### 4.2 Question Set 2<a name="q2"></a>
<BR><BR>
1. **Question set name:** Listing Quality attribute scenarios and Utility Tree
2. **Purpose:** Use this question set to verify if all architecturally significant requirement is listed with a utility tree that can aid in decision making throughout the process of system development.
3. **Stakeholders and concerns:** System architects should be able to use the AD and take the decision in the design process.
| Questions | Respondents | Expected answers | Criticality |
|-------------|-------------|-----|------|
| Q1 - Is there  a mapping between business goals and ASR's?<BR><BR> Q2 - Do we have clear and well documented(template form) QAS ?<BR><BR> Q3 -  Find out if the identified ASR's complete and contain both aspects of the system: quality attribute and business requirements.<BR><BR> Q4 - Are the priorities mentioned on the utility tree make sense in accordance to business goals.<BR><BR> Q5 - Find out if we still have any untouched areas that need more attention and investigation.     | Self(Architect) | The quality attribute scenarios should have direct connection with the project. The selection and prioritization should have relevance to the business goals. The QAS should be listed and documented in the standard template form.  | Questions that map directly with ASR's with the high priority on the utility tree should be answered.       |
5. **Advice:** This question can be reused with any other system that has to validate its ASR and utility tree with quality attributes and business goals.
<BR><BR>
#### 4.3 Question Set 3 <a name="q3"></a>
<BR><BR>
1. **Question set name:** Module View completeness
2. **Purpose:** This question set can be used to verify if the designed module view of the system is complete and can answer questions from different stakeholders.
3. **Stakeholders and concerns:** Those individuals that will interact with the system on modular level, especially developers or any new comers.
| Questions | Respondents | Expected answers | Criticality |
|-------------|-------------|-----|------|
| Q1 - Is it easy to identify all the units that form the software system? Their dependencies and placement in the project structure?<BR><BR> Q2 - Find out if it is possible to comprehend about the key quality attribute scenarios from the previous stage.  <BR><BR>Q3 -  Are the notations clear and as per industry standard in the documentation diagrams ? <BR><BR>Q4 - The catalogue that explains various components is not just the definition of them but how they explain the QAS in previous scenario.<BR><BR>  Q5 - Is the behavior of the system well documented?     | Self(Software Developer, Software Manager,Testers. | The diagrams should be complete with not just a laundry list of all components. The level of abstraction should be well understood and defined in each section of the AD.  | Questions related to the modular structure of the system should be answered correctly because that form the base of further documentation.       |
5. **Advice:** This question set is specific to the AD where the system is just presented with a modular structure and each component within is explained as per a specific quality attribute scenario.
<BR><BR>
#### 4.4 Question Set 4 <a name="q4"></a>
<BR><BR>
1. **Question set name:** Component Connector View completeness
2. **Purpose:** This question set can be used to verify if the designed component connector view of the system is complete and can answer questions from different stakeholders.
3. **Stakeholders and concerns:** Those individuals that will interact with the system on the run-time level, especially developers or any newcomers.
| Questions | Respondents | Expected answers | Criticality |
|-------------|-------------|-----|------|
| Q1 - Is it easy to identify all the units that form the software system at the run-time? Their dependencies and placement in the project structure? Can you comprehend their interactions ?<BR><BR> Q2 - Find out if it is possible to comprehend the key quality attribute scenarios from the previous stage.<BR><BR>  Q3 -  Are the notations clear and as per industry standard in the documentation diagrams ?<BR><BR> Q4 - How well the interactions have been defined? The catalog that explains various components is not just the definition of them but how they explain the QAS in previous scenario.<BR><BR>  Q5 - Can we comprehend the behavior of interaction among components, Do we have a well defined contextual diagram?     | Self(Software Developer, Software Manager, Testers) | The reasoning for the QAS should be easy and straightforward. The selected model for diagram should do justice to the system. The interactions between different components at run-time should be clear.  | Questions related to the runtime structure and component interactions should be correctly answered.       |
5. **Advice:** This question set is specific to the AD where the system where we have generated a document to describe the run-time interaction of the system with various interfaces that interact with it.

### 5. Planning the Review <a name="plan"></a>
<BR><BR>
Planning plays a vital role in the success of AD review. Effective reviews take care of logistics related to system and its stakeholders. While planning our review we have considered following steps: -
* Our review has been done after the system is running and documentation is ready.
* We will give time for answering questions until the deadline to submit the review.
* The review results will be communicated using the Summary section attached to the document.
* We will not interact with actual stakeholders but will try to understand their prospective when answering questions.
